# Informal explanation- after examining the data - the reason that the data was 
  # log transformed was in order to "normalize" the data. Right now, almost every
  # observed protein from the sample has a heavy skew to the left. Log transforming
  # these values would lessen the skew, making it easier to perform meaningful
  # statistical analysis

# Informal explanation - upregulated or downregulated data (compared to a control sample)
# will not be normally distributed, which can be problematic if we want to use a parametric statistical test.
# Also, by log transforming the data, upregulated and downregulated expression data 
# can then have a similar scale of changes.
