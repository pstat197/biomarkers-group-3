## Abstract

Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that describes the contents of your write-up.

## Dataset

Write a brief data description, including: how data were obtained; sample characteristics; variables measured; and data preprocessing. This can be largely based on the source paper and should not exceed 1-2 paragraphs.

-   Background: levels of proteins in plasma/serum are altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

-   Data comes from Hewitson et al. (2021). Blood biomarker discovery for autism spectrum disorder: A proteomic analysis. PLoS One. 2021 Feb 24

-   has serum samples from 76 boys with ASD and 78 typically developing (TD) boys, 18 months-8 years of age

-   A total of 1,125 proteins were analyzed from each sample (1,317 measured, 192 unknown onesfailed quality control)

-   the published analysis excluded 192 unidentified variables that we will include in our analysis

-   outliers were handled by clipping any z-transformed values less than -3 and greater than 3 to -3 and 3, respectively.

-   ours includes simplifications: repeated RF (Random Forest) fitting, forward selection in the logistic regression model, and repeated estimation of AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics) for the final classifier(s) were excluded.

-   Our goal: explore sensitivity of results to certain design choices methodology

SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS: see slide 6 of first lecture

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

The paper by Hewitson et al. discussed identifying biological markers for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk through proteins. They combined three algorithms and utilized machine learning to ultimately form a panel of proteins that may be useful as a blood biological marker to predict ASD risk in boys. They trained random forest models 1,000 times using normalized data. Each protein's importance value, which was represented using mean decrease in Gini Index, was averaged over the 1,000 random forest simulations and the 10 proteins with the highest averaged importance values were selected. They used t-tests to examine the significant differences between means of the two groups, ASD and TD, and selected the 10 proteins with the highest significant t-test values. They also calculated each protein's correlation with ADOS total scores to measure ASD severity, and selected the 10 proteins with the highest absolute value of correlation coefficients.

They then found 5 'core' proteins- mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), immunoglobulin D (IgD), dermatopontin (DERM), ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2), and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)- that were commonly selected across the three methods (random forest, t-test, and correlation approach). They then trained a logistic regression predictive model with these core proteins while adding the leftover 13 proteins one by one, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for a test dataset. This helped them identify 4 additional proteins, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 \[ROR1\], platelet receptor Gl24 \[GI24\], eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H \[elF-4H\], and arylsulfatase B \[ARSB\], that increased the AUC, resulting in a final panel of 9 proteins.

They also evaluated the impacts of ethnicity, seasonal allergies, age, and psychiatric medications as potential confounding factors using t-tests or Spearman's rank correlation, and found that ethnicity and seasonal allergies had no effect, and that age and use of psychiatric medication had insignificantly small effects.

## Findings

Summarize your findings here. I've included some subheaders in a way that seems natural to me; you can structure this section however you like.

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

Tasks 1-2

The first task required us to use the raw data to examine the distribution of the protein amounts. We did this in order to find out why the data was log transformed in the final version of the data set, before they began to use the data set for modeling and predictive purposes. The first step we took during this task was to grab a sample of proteins from the data set. In the interest of randomness and simplicity, we pulled columns 15:25 from the raw data set, giving us a sample of 10 unknown proteins. Secondly, we pivoted the data long, in order to simplify our next task in ggplot. Lastly, we created histograms of the random sample of 10 proteins (reminder that these results are from the raw data before any log transformations).

After examining the histograms of the raw data, it is clear to see why the team decided to log transform the protein levels before beginning statistical analysis. The purpose of log transforming data is to make highly skewed data less skewed, which can be valuable for a many different purposes including predictive modeling. In addition to being highly skewed, most of the proteins have a high density in a small area, which a log transformation will also help with.

### Methodlogical variations

In the third task we conducted the same experiment from the paper but this time we partitioned the data into a testing and training data set in order to conduct accuracy metrics with our models and testing set. Instead of only selecting the top ten proteins from each model and the common proteins among them, in this analysis we selected the top twenty proteins from the random forest model, the t-test, and the correlation with ADOS model. From there we used a fuzzy intersection, where we examined the elements that are common in at least n of the sets. Therefore in this experiment we can look at the proteins that were selected in two of the models. In this case we used the random forest model and the t-test model to examine which ten proteins were common among them. After using each model on our data we found that the "Top 10" common proteins were IgD, Cadherin-5, RELT, DERM, LT-4, Troponin I, skeletal,fast twitch, MAPK2, MATN2, IGFBP-1,M2-PK. These are identified as the "Core Proteins" that were common to both of the methods.

### Improved classifier
